          I'm a web developer. Totally into crafting apps that are modern, super fast, and always responsive. Turning ideas into friendly, awesome-looking interfaces is my jam, always aiming to make the user experience top-notch.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Over time, Iâ€™ve been involved in several projects, using React, Nextjs, Nodejs, plus TypeScript and other tools from that JavaScript world. Clean architecture, reusable bits, and everything working smoothly on every device are what I aim for.

          Also, I have a handle on UX/UI, SEO, and boosting performance. Working with REST APIs, auth stuff, and managing data with tools like Context API, Zustand, and React Query is nothing new. Deployment uses Firebase, Vercel mostly, nicely hooked up to GitHub Actions, keeping the workflow nice.

          Curiosity is what gets me goin', and i never stop learning. Exploring new tools, knowing the tech landscape, and coming up with clever, effective solutions really rocks my world. New challenges, where i can grow and help teams and their products. always up for it.
